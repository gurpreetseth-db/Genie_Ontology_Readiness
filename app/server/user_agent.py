"""Outbound ``User-Agent`` for the app's Databricks API calls.

Builds the ``User-Agent`` header this app stamps on every Databricks API call it
makes (SQL Statement Execution, the Genie Conversation API, SCIM, serving
endpoints / Foundation Model API, Lakebase credential minting, catalog/domain
reads), so its requests are identified by a descriptive, versioned client token
instead of a generic HTTP-client default. This is standard client hygiene: a
well-behaved API client names and versions itself.

Each tab of the critical user journey identifies itself distinctly:

    genie-ontology-readiness-assess/<version>
    genie-ontology-readiness-plan/<version>
    genie-ontology-readiness-learn/<version>

Calls outside a tabbed request (app bootstrap ``/config``, background/unattended
runs, the SDK ``WorkspaceClient``) use the un-suffixed base token:

    genie-ontology-readiness/<version>

The active phase is held in a contextvar set once per request by a router-level
dependency (see ``routes/__init__.py``), mirroring how the OBO user token is
scoped per request. Because the app never hands API work to threads/executors,
the contextvar is visible to every aiohttp session created while serving the
request, so a shared service module (``sql_client`` etc.) reports the phase of
whichever tab invoked it.
