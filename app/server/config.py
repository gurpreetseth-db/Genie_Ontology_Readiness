"""Configuration and authentication for Databricks SQL Warehouse, Lakebase, and Genie.

This app reads the *customer's existing* environment to assess Genie Ontology
readiness. It does not seed demo data.

Auth is on-behalf-of-user (OBO) by default:
  - When Databricks Apps **user authorization** is enabled and a user token is
    forwarded (``x-forwarded-access-token``), every signal runs as the
    **logged-in user**, inheriting their Unity Catalog permissions — so the app
    SP need not be granted on every catalog. The per-request token is held in a
    contextvar.
  - If an OBO read fails (e.g. the viewer lacks a grant the SP holds, such as
    system tables), ``execute_sql`` transparently **falls back to the app SP**.
  - ``get_auth_headers(force_sp=True)`` is the SP-only override, for reads the
    OBO token can't perform (Genie REST API — not covered by the ``sql`` scope;
    Lakebase credential minting — the SP owns the Postgres role).
  - With no forwarded token (local dev / unattended / scheduled), reads run as
    the SP directly.
