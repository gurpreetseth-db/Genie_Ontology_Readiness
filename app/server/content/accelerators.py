"""Accelerators — curated, self-serve assets that raise a pillar's readiness score.

Where the content library (`library.py`) explains *what* a pillar is and *why* it
matters, accelerators give the customer something *runnable* to close the gap: a
notebook, SQL script, dashboard, DAB, or external repo. Each accelerator is tied
to the capability (pillar) it improves and to the assessment signal(s) it lifts,
so the Learn tab can surface it per-pillar and the Plan can recommend it by name.

This is a data registry (like `library.py`) — add accelerators here via PR. Keep
`key` stable; it is the API/UI identity. Set `valid_as_of` and use
`superseded_by` when a stop-gap is replaced by a native API/feature.

Artifacts that ship with the app live under `app/accelerators/<dir>/`; the app
serves a download + an import command (no workspace write permission required).
Accelerators that point at an external repo (e.g. UCX) carry no bundled artifact.
