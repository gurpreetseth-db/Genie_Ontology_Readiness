"""Methodology — how to actually *build* AI-ready business semantics.

Where `library.py` explains *what* each pillar is and `accelerators.py` gives
the customer something *runnable*, this module encodes the *method*: the
phased, iterative process for curating metric views, Genie Agents, and the
governed tags/domains that make them discoverable — so an AI agent can answer
accurately and consistently.

It exists for two consumers:

  1. The **Plan** LLM — `methodology_prompt()` returns a compact, token-frugal
     digest that grounds generated plans in a real build methodology (not
     generic project-management filler), so the "Suggested sequence" reflects
     how semantics are actually built and validated.
  2. Future **Learn**-tab surfacing — the structured `PHASES` / `PRACTICES`
     registries can back a "How to build this" view per capability.

This is a data registry (like the other content modules): edit the phases and
practices here via PR. Keep it product-accurate and free of any customer- or
engagement-specific detail — it ships in a public, customer-deployable app.

The longer, human-readable version of this same methodology lives at
`docs/building-ai-ready-semantics.md` (repo-only; not synced into the app).
