"""API routes package — aggregates all routers under /api.

Each router is included under the CUJ phase it serves, so outbound Databricks
API calls made while handling its requests are tagged with the matching product
(``genie-ontology-readiness-<phase>``). The tagging itself happens in the
aiohttp/SDK layers; here we only pin the phase into the request context via a
router-level dependency. ``config`` carries no phase (app bootstrap → base
product).
