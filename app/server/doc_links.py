"""Cloud-aware Databricks documentation links.

Every embedded docs link is authored against the AWS docs
(``https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/<path>``). On an Azure or GCP deployment
those point at the wrong cloud's docs, so we rewrite the base at serve time to
match the cloud the app is running on:

    AWS    https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/<path>
    GCP    https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/<path>
    Azure  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/<path>

The page ``<path>`` is identical across all three clouds (verified for every doc
page this app links to), so no per-link mapping table is needed. The rare page
that has no equivalent on a non-AWS cloud is listed in ``AWS_ONLY_PATHS`` and
falls back to the AWS URL. ``scripts/verify_doc_links.py`` HEAD-checks coverage
across clouds so that set stays accurate; nothing here makes network calls.

This module is intentionally dependency-free (pure string logic) so it can be
unit-tested without the app's runtime dependencies.
